        <h2>What is Cyber Security?</h2>
        <p>The phrase cyber security can be used to describe many different aspects of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks.
        This is not only referring to attacks against digital information. Digital attacks can be conducted on infrastructure systems such as power grids, health systems,
        banking systems as well as many others.</p>
        <p>To combat against cyber attacks, it is important to have a strategy in place to protect your systems. This applies both to individuals as well as organizations, large or small.
        The scope of the strategy can vary significantly in scope.</p>
